  <h1>NYC:The Big Apple</h1>
 <p> Welcome to the Big Apple! New York City is a vibrant and exciting place, with endless things to see and do. Starting out as a dutch colony in 1625, this city has grown rapidly for last 300-400 years. The nickname "Big Apple" was used first as a reward for horse racers. Who ever won the horse race would get a "Big" Apple, symbolizing the biggest and best one can achieve. Despite being notoriously known for high rent, expensive items and overcrowding, NYC is a city unlike any other. Come take this journey with me as I walk you through this beautiful city! </p>
